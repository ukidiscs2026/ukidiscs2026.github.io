The UKI Discs Meeting 2026 will take place in [Meeting Room 2 (MR2) at the Centre for Mathematical Sciences, Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics]([[https://maps.herts.ac.uk](https://www.cms.cam.ac.uk/how-find-us)]). The department is within walking distance of nearby Churchill College (5min), the Institute of Astronomy (10min), Westminster College (15min), and the city center (20min). Bus info TBD.

## Accommodation {#Accommodation} 
Information coming soon.
/*Student rooms are available on the de Havilland Campus at the University of Hertfordshire. These are a convenient and affordable option:
- **£70** per night (room only)  
- **£85** per night (room with breakfast<sup><a href="#breakfast-note">[1]</a></sup>)

Each room includes a wardrobe, desk, and a small ensuite bathroom, with access to a shared kitchen located on each corridor. Photos below show typical rooms and facilities, courtesy of UH Venues.

There are relatively few budget hotel options in Hatfield this year. The nearby Travelodge is charging slightly more than the student rooms. Other local hotels include the Premier Inn (fairly good value but not within easy walking distance) and the Comet Hotel, a luxury option very close to the venue.

## Getting Here {#GettingHere}
### *Arriving by train*
Cambridge has two train stations, Cambridge North and Cambridge. We recommend arriving at Cambridge, which  is located just 2 miles from the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics. The station sits on the Great Northern Line, with regular direct services from London Kings Cross, making it easily accessible from central London and surrounding areas.

From Cambridge Station, you can reach the department by bus (£3, 10–15 minutes) or by taxi/Uber (approximately £8–£12, 10-12 min) minutes). The main bus routes serving the university are the 614 and 644, which depart from Stop 3 just outside the station and stop directly at both campuses. Services run frequently on weekdays, with slightly reduced schedules during evenings and weekends. For live schedules and ticket info, visit the UNO Bus website.

### *Arriving by (long-distance) coach*
You can travel to Cambridge from other parts of the UK by long-distance coach via National Express, which operates services that stop at Parkers Piece (near the centre of town) and Madingley Park and Ride in west Cambridge. The latter is about a 21min walk from the department.

### *Arriving by car*

For those wishing to park at the de Havilland campus, there is a large open air car park that you'll come into as you drive on to campus. It's marked **DH1** on the map here: [https://www.herts.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/66774/campus-parking.pdf](https://www.herts.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/66774/campus-parking.pdf)

The university charges £3/day (or free for the first 2 hours) with payment via **Hozah**. The procedure is to sign up once only at their website ([https://hozah.com/uhparking/](https://hozah.com/uhparking/)) providing your registration and payment details. Then everything is taken care of automatically, using automated number plate recognition to trigger payments. You can sign up before or after you arrive but **must do so by midnight on the day you first park**.

> **N.B.** After clicking "Pay as you go" on the website, **DO NOT CLICK THE BOX** asking  
> "Are you a Student?" — this refers to University of Hertfordshire students, who  
> are **not allowed** to park there.

Further details are at:  
[https://www.herts.ac.uk/contact-us/parking](https://www.herts.ac.uk/contact-us/parking)  
You can ignore the mention of residential parking information since that refers to UH students.

### *Arriving by plane*
Cambridge is relatively easy to reach from several London airports via public transport:

- From Stansted Airport (closest option), TBD.
- From Heathrow Airport, TBD.
- From Luton Airport, TBD.
- National Express operates a coach service from Stansted Airport that stops directly at TBD in Cambridge.

These routes offer convenient and cost-effective options for reaching Cambridge from London’s major airports.
