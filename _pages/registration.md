Registration opens on 4 April.

Abstract submission for talks has now been extended by 1 week to **Thursday 22 May**, but poster submissions remain open until the registration deadline.

Final registration and payment deadline: **31 July**

Registration costs **£110 for staff** and **£95 for students**, which includes lunch and coffee breaks on all three days. For those attending remotely, the fee is £10.

The meeting spans three days of traditional conference-style talks and discussion sessions. The Scientific Organising Committee (SOC) will select talks to reflect a broad range of topics, with a substantial proportion allocated to early-career researchers. This is a hybrid event, aimed at increasing accessibility for those unable to attend in person. While most talks will be presented on-site, a limited number of remote presentations will be considered upon request. We aim to ensure that everyone who submits an abstract has the opportunity to present—either as a talk or a poster.

**Abstract submission is now closed**

i) **Shopping Basket Selection**  
You can select items for purchase (Registration Fee, Accommodation if wanted) one at a time and add each to your shopping basket before paying.

ii) **Guest Checkout**  
When you go to checkout, if you do it as a *Guest* rather than creating an account, please **tick the box** to allow your name and email to be retained so that we know you have paid.

iii) **Breakfast Availability**  
Breakfast is only available on **Tuesday and Wednesday mornings**.  
Hence, if you buy **"3 Nights accommodation + Breakfast"** (Check-in Sunday 7th, Check-out Wednesday 10th), this **does not include breakfast on Monday 8th**.  
There are a few local options on or near campus where you can get breakfast that day.

If you only want to book **1 night** accommodation, please email [discs2025@herts.ac.uk](mailto:discs2025@herts.ac.uk) to let us know which night.  
If you book **2 nights**, we will assume it's **check-in Monday 8th and check-out Wednesday 10th**.
